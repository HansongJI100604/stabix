function f = abaqus_double_bias(num_elements, p, f1, f2, varargin)
%% Function used to calculate the bias for a segment (based on bias used in Abaqus)
% num_elements is the number of frequency points at which results are to be
% given within a frequency interval (discussed above) (1 to 1e4 in Abaqus);
% k is one such frequency point (k = 1,2,...n);
% f1 is the lower limit of the frequency interval;
% f2 is the upper limit of the frequency interval;
% fk is the frequency at which the kth results are given;
% p is the bias parameter value (1 to 1e6 in Abaqus); and
% f is the frequency or the logarithm of the frequency, depending on the value used for the frequency scale parameter.

% A bias parameter, p, that is greater than 1.0 provides closer spacing of
% the results points toward the ends of the frequency interval, while values
% of p that are less than 1.0 provide closer spacing toward the middle of
% the frequency interval. The default bias parameter is 3.0 for an
% eigenfrequency interval and 1.0 for a range frequency interval.
